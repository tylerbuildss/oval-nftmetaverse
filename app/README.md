# OvalNFT Metaverse Engine

OvalNFT is building infrastructure for Web3-native experiences across NFTs, tokenized assets, and the Metaverse. This repository includes the mobile SDK and supporting modules used in early development of Ovalâ€™s brand-facing tools.

## Overview

This codebase was originally designed for experimental use cases involving NFT deployment, dynamic metadata handling, and campaign-driven mint logic. Over time, it has evolved into a modular toolkit supporting:

- Smart contract interaction  
- Solana-based NFT minting and validation  
- Campaign configuration with token-gated logic  
- Localization support for international rollouts  

## Architecture

The mobile layer uses a simplified Java framework for Android, with support for Gradle-based builds and third-party integrations. Blockchain interactions are abstracted for flexibility, allowing teams to customize or extend core functions based on campaign needs.

## Development Status

This repo serves as a foundation for internal tools and future open-access developer kits. While still in active use, most of the features have been integrated into other private modules used across the OvalNFT ecosystem.
